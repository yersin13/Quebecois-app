        name: 'Poutine',
        recipe: 'Poutine is a dish of french fries and cheese curds topped with a brown gravy. It emerged in Quebec, Canada, in the late 1950s in the Centre-du-Québec region, though its origins are uncertain and there are several competing claims of having invented the dish. For many years it was perceived negatively and mocked, and even used by some to stigmatize Quebec society. Poutine later became celebrated as a symbol of Québécois culture and the province of Quebec. It has long been associated with Quebec cuisine, and its rise in prominence has led to popularity throughout the rest of Canada, in the northern United States, and internationally.',

        recipe: 'In Quebec cuisine, cretons (sometimes gorton or corton, especially among New Englanders of French-Canadian origin) is a forcemeat-style pork spread containing onions and spices. Due to its fatty texture and taste, it resembles French rillettes. Cretons are usually served on toast as part of a traditional Quebec breakfast.

Sufficient milk must be added such that it is not dry after the baking. It is called Pets de Soeur as it was served by Nuns at boarding schools in some parts of the province of Quebec. If milk is not added, then they should be called Nombrils de Soldats, literally Soldier navels, and not Pets de Soeurs. They are very similar to cinnamon rolls but are not leavened.',
